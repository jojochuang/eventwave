/**

 *
 * A high-level event is a conceptual execution of event. The old event model in Mace says the event starts when (1) transport layer processes a received message, (2) Timer goes off, or (3) Asynchronous event handler processes an asynchronous message. An event ends when the event handler finishes the processing. 
 *
 * In Full Context model, events are created by the head of virtual node. The head assigns a globally unique event id to the event, and routes the event to the physical node based on the context of the event. 
 * The reason for having a high-level event in addition to the existing low-level event is that a high-level event is composed of several low-level events. Low level events starts and ends on the same physical machine, whereas the conceptual, high-level event, because it can transition to different contexts during the execution, it is likely the execution of the event spans across many physical nodes.
