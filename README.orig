Thanks for downloading the Mace source package.  Mace is a toolkit and language
for building distributed systems.  Mace documentation can be found in the docs
directory, and there is a short README about the modelchecker in the
application/modelchecker directory.  The License is available in the LICENSE
file, and is a BSD-style license.

Please email us to let us know if you're using Mace and how, we'd love to hear
from you.


Quick Start:
------------

Mace uses cmake to configure it's build system.  Provided that you have
everything installed already, first create a directory for building Mace.
Then, from within that directory, run "cmake [path-to-mace-checkout]".  It will
check your configuration, and create the build system.  Then you can run "make"
to build Mace.  If you want to change the configuration parameters, running
"make edit_cache" will open an editor for setting the build flags and other
configuration options.  "make help" will also show you a list of runnable make
commands.  See docs/mace_HOWTO.pdf for more details on using cmake.

If you wish to compile fewer services than those distributed, you can edit
services/CMakeLists-services.txt.  (You can also add new services here.) You
can also select applications by editing at application/CMakeLists.txt, and you
can add new applications anywhere using one of the sample CMakeLists.txt in the
application directories, and either setting up a new cmake project which uses
the Mace project, or which is included in mace/application/CMakeLists.txt.

Mace is not tested on g++ versions before 3.4, and in particular has been known
to cause internal compiler segfaults with version 3.3.  g++ versions 4.0.x have
also been known, at least on Debian systems, to contain a (reported and
confirmed) bug which causes them to emit warnings when Mace code is compiled
with -O2 and -Wall.  You can either turn off -Werror, or compile with 3.4 or
4.1, 4.2, or 4.3.
